      Timothy Raymond is a highly experienced transformer engineer with over two decades of expertise in all aspects of transformer application, 
      specification, design, testing, operation, and maintenance. Based in Glenville, NY, Timothy has developed a strong reputation for his 
      extensive work in utility asset management, high voltage testing, and data-driven transformer diagnostics.

      Prior to forming Inductive Reasoning Engineering Services, Mr. Raymond served as a Technical Executive at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), 
      leading research projects and providing technical expertise in the power transformer and asset analytics areas. With a background deeply rooted in asset 
      analytics, Timothy's contributions have significantly advanced transformer fleet condition assessments and risk mitigation strategies. His expertise 
      extends to transformer thermal ratings, field diagnostic testing, and forensic investigations, particularly in power transformer and bushing failures.

      Prior to his tenure at EPRI, Timothy worked at Power Delivery Consultants, Inc., where he honed his skills in transformer diagnostics, failure investigations, 
      and software development for transformer rating and condition assessment systems.

      Timothy holds a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Engineering in Electric Power Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and is currently pursuing 
      a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Clarkson University, with an expected completion in 2025. His professional affiliations include senior membership in the 
      Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and he holds a Professional Engineering licenses in New York.

      In addition to his technical contributions, Timothy holds Patent 10,488,384 for a system and method for assessing power transformers, granted in 2019. He has 
      authored multiple publications and contributed to critical industry guidelines, including his work on the IEEE C57.91 Guide for Loading Mineral-Oil Immersed 
      Transformers.

      Timothy's combination of practical transformer expertise, research acumen, and industry leadership makes him a sought-after expert in the field of power 
      transformer technology and utility asset management.
