          specifications and applicable industry standards, while minimizing cost and maximizing reliability. While it \
          is not practical, nor appropriate, for the reviewer to verify every single detail of the design, checks of key \
          calculations and of critical dimensions and geometry can and should be made to ensure an appropriate design has \
          been proposed that will meet expectations of a long and reliable service life.",

          'Ensuring a quality supplier is essential to the procurement of a reliable power transformer.  Constructing power \
          transformers is an unforgiving business. One small error can result in a multi-million dollar transformer becoming a \
          heap of scrap.  A factory audit can help to ensure that necessary quality control methods are in place and, more \
          importantly, being followed. This will generally involve a visit to the factory and discussions with vendor personnel, \
          preferably following a documented, thorough, and neutral methodology.',

          agreed upon ahead of time between the supplier and the purchaser. This is the final check on manufacturer quality before \
          a transformer leaves the factory is the factory acceptance test. This is a series of tests established by standard and by \
          customer specification. While these tests cannot mimic all stresses and conditions a transformer will undergo over its service\
          life, the tests and test levels have been determined through more than a century of experience to provide a transformer that \
          will perform with the expected reliability.',

          these tasks directly, we can provide engineering support in reviewing proposed processes and procedures or handling exceptions and \

          'Monitoring the condition of operating power transformers and diagnosing incipient fault conditions is a uniquely challenging task.  Faults can \
          and often do, evolve rapidly. The core and windings are not directly accessible, in most respects.  Therefore, data and direct observations are \
          limited. Nonetheless, we do have some useful tools at our disposal.  We have extensive expertise in assessing the condition of power transformers \
          utilizing readily available test data and developing data-driven decision making methodologies and processes.  We can assist in one-off assessments \
          or provide exertise and guidance to implement fleet-wide assessment methodologies.',

          a wealth of expertise, data, and strategic thinking.  We have decades of experience working with utilities to develop data-driven \
          methodologies for improving asset management decision making, deeply rooted in transformer expertise.  This includes capital replacement \

          experience applying analytical methods to develop asset management insights across a wide range of asset classes, including, but not limited to, \
          power transformers.',
