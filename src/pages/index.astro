          is not practical, nor appropriate, for the reviewer to verify every single detail of the design, checks of key \
          calculations and of critical dimensions and geometry can and should be made to ensure an appropriate design has \

          transformers is an unforgiving business. One small error can result in a multi-million dollar transformer becoming a \
          heap of scrap.  A factory audit can help to ensure that necessary quality control methods are in place and, more \
          importantly, being followed. This will generally involve a visit to the factory and discussions with vendor personnel, \
          preferably following a documented, thorough, and neutral methodology.',

          a transformer leaves the factory is the factory acceptance test. This is a series of tests established by standard and by \
          customer specification. While these tests cannot mimic all stresses and conditions a transformer will undergo over its service\
          life, the tests and test levels have been determined through more than a century of experience to provide a transformer that \
          will perform with the expected reliability.',
